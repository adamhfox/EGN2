[2020/10/09 12:45:41] <CFLCC LNO to XVIII ABC COL Barnes> XVIII ABC Future Operations Next 24hrs --
XVIII ABC begins planning efforts for the transition to the defense in the next 24hrs. Their assumption is
that they will destroy the enemy on OBJ Seahawks with 3ID. They also assume 12 COR elements in zone
will be largely attrited and they may have to face the 138 DTG entering the CFLCC and Corps zone.
 
 
The XVIII ABC G35/5 team will establish the framework for two courses of action for the transition to the
defense after consolidating gains from offensive operations. These efforts further support maintaining
the territorial integrity of the international border.
Planning assumptions:
Rear area boundary moves to PL Mike; 1 x SBCT supports wide area security in rear area
ABCT remains the Corps reserve
Divide critical assets to front line Divisions (i.e. Fires, AVN, etc)
Mobile and / or area defense focused on MSR Alaska and routes from Latvia into Lithuania IVO OBJ
Seahawks
Intel assessment required:
